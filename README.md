# Blog & Photograpy Project

## üìñ About This Project
This project is my first attempt at front-end web development. My main motivation was to showcase some of my favorite photography works on this website and share them with everyone. To achieve this, I started with an example template provided by Vercel (https://github.com/Wisp-CMS/nextjs-blog-cms-wisp) as the foundation and then redesigned the website according to my needs and aesthetic preferences. In addition to the basic About page, I added two more pages: Photography and Blog. In the Photography section, I used a Masonry layout to display the photos and also added features and animations for photo switching. I designed appropriate interactions for users on different devices; for example, mobile users can swipe down to close the photo viewer, and they can click on the left or right half of the screen to switch photos. For each photo, users can also see detailed metadata such as the camera and lens used. In the future, I may also add some academic notes compiled from my coursework.
